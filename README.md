# SafeTube

SafeTube is a kid-friendly YouTube viewer designed to serve videos **only** from approved channels and individual videos. The app uses a Flask backend to interface with the YouTube Data API and a React + TailwindCSS frontend (built with Vite) to present videos in a clean, distraction-free UI.

## Features

- ✅ Parent-controlled list of approved channels (via YouTube handle or URL)
- ✅ Approved video curation (not all videos from a channel are necessarily safe)
- ✅ Minimalist UI for young users
- ✅ No search bar, comments, or YouTube recommendations

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Flask + Flask-CORS
- **API**: YouTube Data API v3

## Setup

Coming soon.
